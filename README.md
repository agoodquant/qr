 Dependency
 ===========
 All modules are controlled by a depdency file called "depends.txt". Dependending on the location of your module,</br>
 you would need to edit this file. By default, it is Q drive in windows.

 reflect: show all in memory defined function/data</br>
 optimisation: linear/integer programming</br>
 complex analysis: simple complex number calculation, dft/idft</br>
